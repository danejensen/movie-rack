# Movie Rack Sample Code Exercise

## Background

The Movie Rack application will help movie theaters publish movies and showtimes, and sell tickets to movies.

Coding for the application started yet. The first step of the project is a very rough proof of concept. Some basic requirements have been sketched.

## Requirements

### Tools and Technology
- The application should be written using Rails 3
- It should be specified and tested using RSpec 2
- The database should be SQLite3
- The database schema should be managed with Rails migrations
- Views can be written in either ERB or HAML

### User Experiences
- List movies and showtimes for a chosen theater
- List theaters and showtimes for a chosen movie
- Purchase tickets for a chosen movie and showtime
- Enter the number of tickets to purchase
- When the number of tickets exceeds the number of available seats for a showtime, inform the user
- A theater has a number of "cheap seats" that are 50% of the cost of regular seats

### Exclusions for the Proof of Concept
- Don't worry about listing movies for a given date. This isn't relevant for this rough draft of the app
- Don't worry about styling. Focus more on communicating intent. Minimal, or no CSS at all is acceptable.

## Submitting Your Code

Take the time you need to do this exercise. It's not a race, but we're looking forward to seeing the app.

To submit the code:
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Commit your code to the fork
- When you're done, submit a pull request on GitHub

NOTE: If you're not familiar or comfortable with Git or GitHub, let us know. It's not a problem. We can work around this, or help you through the process.

## Ask for Help if You Need It

If any of the technologies, requirements, expectations, or solution ideas aren't clear to you, don't get stressed about it. Ask us for help and we'll work together to see it through!
